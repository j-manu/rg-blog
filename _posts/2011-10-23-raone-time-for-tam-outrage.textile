  title: Ra One - Time For Tam Outrage
---

h1. {{page.title}}

SRK plays a Tam Iyer in Ra One. Shekhar Subramaniyam. Oh Oh. We all know the <a href="http://www.whatay.com/2004/05/17/the-travails-of-single-south-indian-men-of-conser/" target="_blank">travails of south indian men</a>. But Ra one makers are rubbing it in the face. Sample this from the "synopsis":http://www.reviewgang.com/movies/107-Ra-One-Review. _A son is trying hard to 'dude-up' his dad from 'aiiiyyyo' to 'YO!'._ On reading that and other such gems from the synopsis, I think this is pure vendetta by the "delhi doods" for the <a href="http://raagshahana.blogspot.com/2011/09/open-letter-to-delhi-boy.html" target="_blank">Open Letter</a>. (Did you really think they would let it slide?)

h3. Tam men being stereotyped in Ra One

<ul class="content">
  <li>

    They are "aiyyyyo" rather than "YO"

  </li><li>

    They have bad hair style.<br>

  </li><li>

    They are software engineers. (SRK's character in the story is a video game developer)

  </li><li>

    They dance in veshti !! <br>

    To add insult to injury, the guys in vesthi are accompanied by scantily clad foreigners! If you use the pallu of a kanchipuram saree to make the outfit for these dancers, there will still be cloth left over!

    They are bumbling idiots around women. <br>
    Just watch this Dildara Promo. *Bonus:* You get to see SRK speaking Tamil :) <br>

SRK is not an idiot. He knows all the above will sell well in the North Indian market. But he doesn't want to lose the Tamil Nadu market. So what does he do? Get Rajnikant to do a cameo of course. He is hoping that with one "Rascalla" from Rajnikant, all of SRK's sins will be forgiven and the movie will be playing to packed houses in chennai. Dear 'Dravida Makkal', don't fall for that ploy :)
